# TicTacToe

This program was developed for CS 342: Software Design at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
In this project, we had to design a TicTacToe game with client/server logic. In order to design
the AI for the game, the program uses a MinMax algorithm. The player can choose the difficulty
of the game and that changes how the MinMax algorithm is used.
